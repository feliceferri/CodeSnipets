1) Need to Install Service Fabric SDK in order to create apps from Visual Studio

2) If I create the Service Cluster from Azure, then I can't publish from VS, 
What worked was creating the Service Fabric App in Visual Studio and from there Publish => Create a new Service Fabric
Last tab of this wizzard allows to Open Ports
Ports are open by default as TCP, but then we can go into the Load Balancer and convert them to UDP


Get the IP 
=> Go To Load Balancers

Error 403 when trying to Explore the Service Application App

Visual Studio Cloud Explorer

Cluster TreeNode

1) Enable Debugging
2) Enable Streaming traces
3) Open Service Fabric Explorer

UDEMY STEPS

1) PowerShell as Administrator => Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force -Scope CurrentUser

2) Open Visual Studio as an Administrator

3) Windows Open=> Service Fabric Local Cluster Manager (Appears in the System Tray) (Right click Start Cluster, change from 1 to 5 node Cluster if I want etc)

4) Startup Project is FabricApp (top) not the Stateless Server

4) VS => View => Other Windows => Diagnostic Events
