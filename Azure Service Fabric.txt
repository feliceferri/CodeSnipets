1) Need to Install Service Fabric SDK in order to create apps from Visual Studio

2) PowerShell as Administrator => Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force -Scope CurrentUser

3) If I create the Service Cluster from Azure, then I can't publish from VS, 
What worked was creating the Service Fabric App in Visual Studio and from there Publish => Create a new Service Fabric
Last tab of this wizzard allows to Open Ports
Ports are open by default as TCP, but then we can go into the Load Balancer and convert them to UDP


Get the IP 
=> Go To Load Balancers

Error 403 when trying to Explore the Service Application App
