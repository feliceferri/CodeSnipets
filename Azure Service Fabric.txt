1) Need to Install Service Fabric SDK in order to create apps from Visual Studio

2) If I create the Service Cluster from Azure, then I can't publish from VS, 
What worked was creating the Service Fabric App in Visual Studio and from there Publish => Create a new Service Fabric
Last tab of this wizzard allows to Open Ports
Ports are open by default as TCP, but then we can go into the Load Balancer and convert them to UDP
   => Create New Cluster, 3 nodes
   => Certificate password
   => VM username & Password


allowAllUDPToPort11000  Any * Any Custom 11000  UDP Allow  2000
AllowAllTCPTOPort13000  Any * Any Custom 13000  TCP Allow  2001
VM Firewall => Inbound Rule => New Rule Port => UDP 11000 => UDPPort11000
VM Firewall => Inbound Rule => New Rule Port => TCP 13000 => TCPPort13000


Get the IP 
=> Go To Load Balancers

Load Balancer => Load Balancing Rules => Add => PORT & BackEndport (Repeat Number), probe can be the default one TCP:19000 even if creating an UDP Rule
Network SecurityGroup => Inbound Security Rules => Add => Source Any , port *, Destination Any, Service Custom, Destination Port Range 13000, Name = AllowAllTCPTOPort13000

Add the Service endpoint to the ServerManifest.xml
<Resources>
    <Endpoints>
      <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpointTCP" Port="13000" Protocol="tcp"/>
    </Endpoints>
  </Resources>
</ServiceManifest>

Error 403 when trying to Explore the Service Application App

----------------------

Visual Studio Cloud Explorer

Cluster TreeNode

1) Enable Debugging
2) Enable Streaming traces
3) Open Service Fabric Explorer

--------------------------


UDEMY STEPS

1) PowerShell as Administrator => Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force -Scope CurrentUser

2) Open Visual Studio as an Administrator

3) Windows Open=> Service Fabric Local Cluster Manager (Appears in the System Tray) (Right click Start Cluster, change from 1 to 5 node Cluster if I want etc)

4) Startup Project is FabricApp (top) not the Stateless Server

4) VS => View => Other Windows => Diagnostic Events

------------------

MULTIPLE LISTENERS

1) ServiceManifest.xml

<Resources>
    <Endpoints>
      <!-- This endpoint is used by the communication listener to obtain the port on which to 
           listen. Please note that if your service is partitioned, this port is shared with 
           replicas of different partitions that are placed in your code. -->
      <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpoint" Port="11000" Protocol="udp"/>
      <Endpoint Name="ServiceEndpointTCP" Port="13000" Protocol="tcp"/>
    </Endpoints>
  </Resources>

2)  protected override IEnumerable<ServiceInstanceListener> CreateServiceInstanceListeners()
        {
            //return new ServiceInstanceListener[0]; //This is the default code it read only the first ServiceEndPoint

            List<ServiceInstanceListener> listeners = new List<ServiceInstanceListener>();
            listeners.AddRange(new ServiceInstanceListener[0]);
            listeners.AddRange(new ServiceInstanceListener[1]);

            return listeners;
         }
