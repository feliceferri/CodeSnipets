AZURE IOT HUB

1) Shared Access policies => click iothubowner => keys ang connection string

UWP => Set the connection String (from step 1)

Built-in endpoints to set the Consumer Groups
--------------

AZURE FUNCTION TO CONSUME

Connection String => Comes from Azure IOT hub => EndPoints

Add extra nuget package => 
Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs v4.1.0
Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor v4.1.0  

The connectionstring goes in the local.settings.json not in the Run default paramaters (Better to use Environment Variables instead)

* Have to change the Environment Variable (In Azure) for the AzureWebStorage, copying the local.settings.one, they both start the same, but the local one is different (longer)
* Have to create the Environment Variable (In Azure) with the connectionstring of the IOT Hub
------------------------------------------

SET CONSUMERGROUP AS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

[FunctionName("xxxx")]
public static async void Run([IoTHubTrigger("messages/events", Connection = "IOTHubConnectionString", ConsumerGroup = "%IOTHubConsumerGroup%")]EventData message, ILogger log, ExecutionContext exCtx)

Local.Settings.Json => "Values" =>  "IOTHubConsumerGroup": "xxx"
Then do the same in Setting => Environment Variables in the Azure function
