CUSTOM EVENTS (CHILD to PARENT)

//Child component
setup(props,context)

function closeDialog()
{
    context.emit('closeDialog',true);
}

//Parent component
<component @closeDialog="setShowModal(false)" ></component>

** Outside the setup method => this.$emit() should be use (haven't tried it)

Provide / inject to pass variables from Component to Descendants, including from App to all the components (https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html#inject)
